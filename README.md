# Sales_prediction
📊 Sales Forecasting Project A time-series analysis project that predicts future sales using ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models. Includes data visualization, trend/seasonality analysis, and actionable business insights.
🔍 Overview
This project focuses on predicting future sales using historical time-series data. Leveraging models like ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM, it aims to help businesses make informed decisions in areas like inventory planning, promotions, and demand forecasting.

🔍 Dataset
Source: Walmart Sales Dataset – Kaggle
Description: This dataset contains historical sales data for various Walmart stores and departments across different dates. It includes information such as weekly sales, store types, CPI's ,Fuel Prices,Temperature, enabling detailed time-series forecasting and analysis.

🎯 Project Goals
Forecast future sales based on historical trends

Model seasonal, promotional, and holiday effects

Compare performance of statistical and deep learning models

Visualize actual vs predicted sales

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python, Jupyter Notebook

pandas, numpy – Data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn, plotly – Visualization

statsmodels – ARIMA model

fbprophet – Forecasting with holidays and trends

TensorFlow/Keras – LSTM neural networks

📊 Results
The forecasting models are evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). These results help assess how accurately each model predicts future sales. Visual comparisons of actual vs. forecasted sales are also used to interpret model performance and seasonality capture.
